# Godot Tiny MMO

**Experimental open-source MMORPG framework** built with **Godot 4**.  
Inspired by proven MMO systems, this project pushes the boundaries of what can be achieved with Godot in large-scale multiplayer.  
It explores scalable multiplayer architecture, efficient byte-packed networking, while staying clear and simple in our learning journey.

- **Cross-platform**: browser + desktop + mobile
- **Unified codebase**: Client & multiple servers in one repo
  - Faster iteration, develop in one place, test in one click
  - Separate export presets for clean client/server builds 
- **"Custom netcode"** but stay simple  
  - No reliance on Godotâ€™s `MultiplayerSynchronizer/Spawner` for better control
  - Packed protocol format (efficient PackedByteArray instead of string-based messages) for hot synchronization
  - Entity interpolation, multi-map instances, seamless transitions
- **True MMOO architecture**
  - **Gateway server**: authentication & routing
  - **Master server**: orchestrator, account management & bridge between gateways and world servers
  - **World server**: host multiple concurrent maps and instances; the place where gameplay actually happens

## Getting Started

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in **Godot 4.4 or 4.5**.
2. Go to Debug tab, select **"Customizable Run Instance..."**.
3. Enable **Multiple Instances** and set the count to **4 or more**.
4. Under **Feature Tags**, ensure you have:
   - Exactly **one** "gateway-server" tag.
   - Exactly **one** "master-server" tag.
   - Exactly **one** "world-server" tag.
   - At least **one or more** "client" tags.
5. (Optional) Under **Launch Arguments**:
   - For servers, add **--headless** to prevent empty windows.
   - For any, add **--config=config_file_path.cfg** to use non-default config path.
6. Run the project (Press F5).
