# Godot Tiny MMO

A simple web MMO / MMORPG developed with Godot Engine 4.x - 4.3, created without relying on the built-in multiplayer nodes.  

This project contains both client and server within the same codebase.  
Using custom export presets, you can easily separate client and server builds  
(see the Wiki: [**Exporting Client and Server separately**](https://github.com/SlayHorizon/godot-tiny-mmo-demo/wiki/Exporting-the-project)).  
This setup enables client-only exports without server components and vice versa,  
keeping your builds optimized and secure.  

For additional details, check out the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/SlayHorizon/godot-tiny-mmo-demo/wiki).
