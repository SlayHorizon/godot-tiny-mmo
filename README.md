# Godot Tiny MMO

A small-scale MMO / MMORPG developed with Godot Engine 4.3, without relying on the built-in multiplayer nodes.  

Both the client and server are included within the same project, utilizing export presets to manage the separation.  
These presets allow to export only the client-side without including server components, and vice versa.  

Feel free to explore the project details in the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/SlayHorizon/godot-tiny-mmo-demo/wiki).
